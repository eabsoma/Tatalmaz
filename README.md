A specialized browser called Tatalmaz has been created to aid students in enhancing their auditory abilities and pronunciation of alphabet letters. An integrated learning program, this browser permits users to upload image-based text and accurately articulate the text with proper diacritics. Furthermore, learners can record their audio pronunciation of an alphabet letter and evaluate it using our model.

# The project consist of four features:
  1- Ability to extract Arabic text from images and read it.
